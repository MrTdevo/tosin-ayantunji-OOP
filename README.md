# Logo Generator
# Description
- This project is a Node.js command-line application designed to generate a simple logo based on user input. The user is prompted to provide text for the logo, select colors for both the text and the shape, and choose a shape. The application then creates an SVG file with the specified logo design.

# Features
Text Input: Users can enter up to three characters for the logo text.
Text Color: Users can specify the text color using either a color keyword (e.g., "red") or a hexadecimal color code (e.g., "#ff0000").
Shape Selection: Users can choose from three shapes: circle, triangle, or square.
Shape Color: Users can specify the shape color using either a color keyword or a hexadecimal color code.
SVG Generation: The application generates an SVG file named logo.svg based on the user input and saves it in the specified directory.
Output Message: After the SVG file is created, the application prints "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.
Browser View: When opened in a browser, the logo.svg file displays a 300x200 pixel image that matches the user-defined criteria.
